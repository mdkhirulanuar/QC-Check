### Local Setup

```bash

Open InspectWiseGo.html directly in the browser, or use a local server:

npx serve .
# or
python3 -m http.server

### ✅ Next Recommendations

- **Add a `service-worker.js`** file to support true offline caching and make your PWA installable.
- **Use semantic HTML tags and ARIA attributes** for accessibility.
- **Organize JavaScript into modular components** if functionality expands.
- **Use `localStorage` or `IndexedDB`** for storing QC logs locally if offline data persistence is needed.
